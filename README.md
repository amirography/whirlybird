<!-- cargo-rdme start -->

`whirlybird` is a library of generic type implementations for [`RedMaple`](https://crates.io/crates/redmaple) library, that offers workflows for different events compatible with common contents like todos, blogs and etc.

`whirlybird` is still in its infancy. And for now, at least, it is not fully formed.
There is a 100% certainty that if I can, I will strip away some items in it.
So please, do not use it for now. Version numbering will tell you if things got stabilised.
